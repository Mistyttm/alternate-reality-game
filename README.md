# Alternate Reality Game

An idea for a game I have, Gotta make use of my time somehow lol

## Main Ideas

* 2D game
* Artstyle??????? (later uwu)
* The game will have multiple realities
* 2 of them

## Mechanic ideas

* player will control 2 characters at once
  * universe 1 will have normal controls
  * universe 2 will be flipped controls
* things you do in universe 1 will affect universe 2
  * e.g. destroying a box in one universe will destroy it in the other universe
  * moving left in universe 1 will move the player righjt in universe 2
* focus can be shifted between each universe to puzzle solve
  * each universe will have slightly different layouts
* The goal can be reqached in either universe 1 or 2 or it can be reached in both at once
* floaty sort of jumping
* universe 1 has a double jump, universe 2 does not
* player will have a gun to shoot things?
  * enemies?
  * boxes, definitely
    * boxes can also be pushed
  * buttons
  * levers?
    * No those can be pushed
